# 🎯 START HERE - Notion Blog Integration

## What Just Happened?

I've reviewed and fixed your entire Notion blog integration code. Your portfolio is ready to display blog posts from Notion - you just need to complete the authentication setup.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: What You Must Do Now

Your blog integration is **99% complete**, but you need to:

### 1. Create a Fresh Notion Integration (2 minutes)

The token you're currently using is invalid. Here's how to get a new one:

1. Visit: **https://www.notion.so/my-integrations**
2. Click: **"+ New integration"**
3. Name it: **"Portfolio Blog"**
4. Make sure **"Read content"** is checked
5. Click **"Submit"**
6. **Copy the integration secret** (starts with `secret_`)

### 2. Share Your Database (1 minute)

1. Go to your "Blog Posts" database in Notion
2. Click the **"..."** menu (top right)
3. Click **"Add connections"**
4. Select **"Portfolio Blog"**

### 3. Update Environment Variables (1 minute)

Edit your `.env.local` file and update this line:

```env
NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=secret_PASTE_YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE
```

The database ID is already correct:
```env
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=1ac77f1f-aee6-8003-a538-c677d2f182a7
```

### 4. Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test!

Visit: **http://localhost:3000/blog**

You should see your blog post: "Bridging the Bias: Ensuring Fairness in Large Language Models"

## 🎓 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Notion    │  ← You write posts here
│  Database   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       │ Notion API
       │
┌──────▼──────────┐
│  Your Portfolio │
│   (Next.js)     │
└─────────────────┘
       │
       │ Browser
       │
┌──────▼──────┐
│   Visitors  │  ← They see your posts here
└─────────────┘
```

When someone visits your blog:
1. Your Next.js app calls `/api/notion`
2. The API fetches posts from your Notion database
3. Posts are displayed on your portfolio
4. No manual updates needed!
