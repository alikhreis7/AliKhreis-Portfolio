## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work, check these common issues:

### ‚ùå "API token is invalid" Error
- [ ] Did you copy the full integration secret (including `secret_` prefix)?
- [ ] Are there extra spaces in your `.env.local` file?
- [ ] Did you share the database with the integration (Step 2)?
- [ ] Did you restart the development server after updating `.env.local`?

### ‚ùå "No Blog Posts Found"
- [ ] Do you have at least one post in your Notion database?
- [ ] Are all required fields (Name, Date, Content Summary) filled in?
- [ ] Are the property names spelled exactly right (case-sensitive)?
- [ ] Is the post in the same database you shared with the integration?

### ‚ùå Changes Not Showing
- [ ] Did you restart your development server?
- [ ] Did you clear your browser cache?
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for errors
- [ ] Check terminal for server errors

### ‚ùå Deployment Issues
- [ ] Did you add environment variables to Vercel?
- [ ] Did you redeploy after adding the variables?
- [ ] Check the Vercel deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Verify the environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
