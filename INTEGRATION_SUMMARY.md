# Notion Blog Integration - What Was Changed

## Summary
I've updated your portfolio to properly connect with your Notion blog database. The main issue was with authentication and how the Notion API token was being handled.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/api/notion/route.ts` ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Fixed TypeScript errors with proper type annotations
- Updated to support multiple environment variable names for backwards compatibility:
  - `NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN` (recommended)
  - `NOTION_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (legacy)
  - `NOTION_API_KEY` (legacy)
- Added better error handling with proper type guards
- Improved logging to help debug connection issues
- Fixed property extraction from Notion API responses

**Why:** The code had TypeScript errors and wasn't properly handling the Notion API types. The authentication was also not flexible enough to handle different token naming conventions.

### 2. `/lib/notion.js` ‚úÖ
**Changes:**
- Updated to support multiple environment variable names
- Improved error messages to be more helpful

**Why:** Consistency with the API route and better backwards compatibility.

## What You Need to Do

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Update Your Environment Variables

You need to update your `.env.local` file with a **fresh Notion integration token**. Here's why:

1. **The current token is invalid** - The 401 errors confirm this
2. **You need to create a new integration** or regenerate the token
3. **You must share your database** with the new integration

### Step-by-Step (5 minutes):

1. **Create Integration:**
   ```
   Visit: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   Click: "+ New integration"
   Name: "Portfolio Blog"
   Enable: "Read content"
   Copy: The integration secret (starts with "secret_")
   ```

2. **Share Database:**
   ```
   In Notion, open your "Blog Posts" database
   Click: "..." menu ‚Üí "Add connections"
   Select: "Portfolio Blog"
   ```

3. **Update `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   # Keep your EmailJS credentials as they are
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=BW12oiGgE44xMbpFa
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_pxm4vry
   NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_zrzpglu

   # Add these new Notion credentials
   NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=secret_paste_your_new_token_here
   NOTION_DATABASE_ID=1ac77f1f-aee6-8003-a538-c677d2f182a7
   ```

4. **Restart Server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Test:**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/blog
   ```

## Notion Database Structure

Make sure your "Blog Posts" database has these exact properties:

| Property Name | Type | Required | Description |
|---------------|------|----------|-------------|
| Name | Title | ‚úÖ Yes | Blog post title (default Notion title property) |
| Date | Date | ‚úÖ Yes | Publication date |
| Content Summary | Text | ‚úÖ Yes | Short description/excerpt |
| Featured Image | Files & media | ‚ùå Optional | Cover image for the post |

**Note:** Property names are case-sensitive!

## How It Works Now

1. **Client Side** (`/app/blog/page.tsx`):
   - Fetches blog posts from your API route
   - Displays them in a nice grid layout
   - Shows loading states and errors

2. **API Route** (`/app/api/notion/route.ts`):
   - Connects to Notion using the official `@notionhq/client`
   - Queries your database for all posts
   - Extracts and formats the data
   - Returns it as JSON

3. **Individual Posts** (`/app/blog/[id]/page.tsx`):
   - Fetches the full post content
   - Renders it using `react-notion-x`
   - Displays the Notion page exactly as it appears in Notion

## Deploying to Vercel

When you push your code to GitHub/deploy to Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add both variables:
   - `NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN`
   - `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`
4. Save and redeploy

**Important:** Your `.env.local` file is not included in git (it's in `.gitignore`), so you must add these variables manually in Vercel.

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "API token is invalid"?
- Double-check you copied the FULL integration secret
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after the token in `.env.local`
- Verify you shared the database with the integration in Notion
- Try creating a completely new integration

### "No Blog Posts Found"?
- Add at least one post to your Notion database
- Make sure the post has all required properties filled in
- Check that property names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Changes Not Showing?
- Restart your development server (environment variables only load on startup)
- Clear your browser cache
- Check the browser console and terminal for error messages

## Need Help?

1. Read `NOTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. Check `QUICK_START.md` for a quick reference
3. Look at the console/terminal for error messages
4. Verify all steps in this document are completed
